<!-- Read this before creating packages: https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/create/create-packages -->
<!-- It is especially important to read the above link to understand additional requirements when publishing packages to the community feed aka dot org (https://community.chocolatey.org/packages). -->

This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements
-->
<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

    <summary>Convert executable installers to MSI packages fast and easy.</summary>
    <description>MSI Wrapper is a tool that can convert non-MSI installers (EXE, scripts, etc.) into standardized MSI packages for streamlined enterprise deployment via systems like SCCM, Intune, or Group Policy.

  Key Features/Capabilities:
  - Repackaging: Transforms EXE, ZIP, or script-based setups into Windows Installer (.msi) format.
  - Silent Installation: Enables unattended deployments with parameters (/qn).
  - Basic Customization: Adds product metadata, shortcuts, registry keys, or file associations.
  - Compatibility: Ensures installer compliance with enterprise management tools (SCCM/WSUS).

  Use Cases:
  - IT admins needing to deploy legacy or non-MSI software across corporate networks.
  - Standardizing third-party apps lacking native MSI support.
